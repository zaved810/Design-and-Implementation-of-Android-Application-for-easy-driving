### PROBLEM STATEMENT:



 Driving a vehicle is a very careful task. It requires a level of expertise and license along with the documents. As a vehicle owner, you are responsible for keeping your vehicle in roadworthy condition as well as presenting it for roadworthiness testing. It requires documents/ certificate for proof. 
 
  Carrying all the documents and certificates daily is challenging. Sometimes people lose or forget them to carry. Suppose the vehicle is stolen, we lose our documents too as we tend to keep the documents inside the vehicle.
  
  
  
  ___
  
  
  
### REASON:



 Obtaining a lost document requires a lot of time and money. People also face registering complaints of a lost vehicle as they would have also lost their documents which proves their point. We have come up with the idea of developing a solution to this problem. 



___

### OBJECTIVE:



 To develop an android application for the necessary documents requires. By the help of application we won’t need to worry about carrying and thus losing our documents. We could also save our time and money to obtain a new document.



___

### LITERATURE SURVEY/ FEASIBILITY STUDY:



 In India around 2 million people lose their driving license or documents every year. However, the figures also show that your age and where you live could decide where you keep your driving license. Younger drivers are far more likely to choose to carry their license with them. The older a driver gets the more likely they are to keep their license at home. Approximately 87% young drivers do not carry their License. 
 
 
 
___

### FUTURE SCOPE:



 This is helpful for people as well as RTO and Police stations investigating a lost vehicle. The roadworthiness certificates are easy to check as it would be readily available. 



___

### METHODOLOGY:



 We will use agile methodology. Agile mobile app development methodology is one of the most effective approaches to all the software development businesses, it ensures a proper channel of communication, which helps both the clients and App Developers execute the desired mobile application or in fact any software. The characteristics of Agile Methodology makes an easy job for mobile app development so that the mobile application outcome is adaptable after its release.
 
 We need to develop two interfaces. An android application for the users and a web portal for RTO. The android application will require its users to sign up with the registered mobile number. An OTP will be generated and the person will be able to register with the number and generate a password. Portal of the RTO will be used to upload and maintain the required details.



___

### Requirements:



 * HARDWARE REQUIRED:
   * 4 GB RAM (Minimum)
   * 10 GB disk space

 * SOFTWARE REQUIRED:
   * Android Studio
   * Java
   * Eclipse
   * Google Firebase



___

### TESTING:



 We will use iterative development workflow model:
As your app expands, you might find it necessary to fetch data from a server, interact with the device's sensors, access local storage, or render complex user interfaces. The versatility of your app demands a comprehensive testing strategy. When developing a feature iteratively, you start by either writing a new test or by adding cases and assertions to an existing unit test. The test fails at first because the feature isn't implemented yet.

 It's important to consider the units of responsibility that emerge as you design the new feature. For each unit, you write a corresponding unit test. Your unit tests should nearly exhaust all possible interactions with the unit, including standard interactions, invalid inputs, and cases where resources aren't available.

### CONTRIBUTION OF THE PROJECT:



 This project helps in saving time, effort and money. It also helps in detection of fake documents and stolen vehicles.



___

### SCOPE FOR EXTENSION:



 We need to create an extra portal for police stations which would help in identifying a lost/ stolen vehicle. A complain could be lodged immediately by the mobile application. 



___

### CONCLUSION:



 People face problems as stated. We have come up with an innovative and effective solution which would solve the given social problem.
